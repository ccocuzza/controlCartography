## Rest-to-Task Comparisons
**Purpose**: compare resting state and task state FC estimates; uses nonparametric permutation testing as well as the Mantel test

**Directory**: Contains demo code for assessing rest-to-task changes in FC; e.g., descriptive analyses of changes to FC architecture between resting state and task-evoked state(s); as opposed to mechanistic and/or functional analyses (see below)
