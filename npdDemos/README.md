## Network Partition Deviation
**Purpose**: the novel metric introduced by this study. Using the empirically adjusted resting-state partition as a reference, one may assess how networks deviate during task-evoked states

**Directory**: Contains demo code for implementing our novel diagnostic metric, network partition deviation (NPD), as well as follow up analyses related to NPD
